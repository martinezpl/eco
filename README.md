# Eco CLI 

`eco` is a CLI tool for personal finance keeping.

It provides a quick way to record your money flow through a simple interface. The records are arranged & kept in neat tables that are being stored in your local `$HOME/eco_tables` path. Moreover, `eco` scraps a daily fun-fact to add a bit of motivation towards regular usage :) 

1. Categorize your budget flow across income-spending-saving trio.  
2. Spend 30 seconds an evening to keep an eye on your pocket!

Yup. That's all it takes to start being an adult.

## Installation

Before installing, make sure you've added `pip` to your local __environment variable__.

`pip install eco-cli`


## Usage

Simply type in `eco` in your terminal to invoke the program. First run will initialize a personalization process, in which you'll create flow categories. 

Use *flow* to register money flow. You can use *summary* for a quick budget peek, or export the .csv files under `$HOME/eco_tables` to your tabular software of choice.
